# 🍃 Breezeden 🌸

> *A quiet place where where ideas float like clouds, 
code grows like grass, and occasionally.*

⛏️ **Built like a Minecraft world** — one block at a time.  
💨 Gentle breezes float around your pixels, whispering secrets of lost CSS.  
🪄 Spells cast: `:hover { happiness: true; }` and `body { calm: infinite; }`  

---

🌸 **What happens here:**  
- 🏰 I build blogs like I build castles (sometimes accidentally in the sky).  
- 🌙 Dark mode appears when the moon rises (or your system prefers it).  
- 🐛 Sometimes magical creatures (well… bugs) wander into the code.

💎 **Powered by:**  
- 🧙‍♂️ Hugo (because wizards need tools)  
- 🎨 Html, CSS & JS charms(the power trio of the web)  
- 🍵 Tea, moonlight, and occasional diamond luck

and the wind always bring you gentle ideas.”* 🌬️
